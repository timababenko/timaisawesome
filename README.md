# Quiz App Template
For a project option, use this template to create a quiz app. In the `index.erb` file you will find the questions and answer options. Feel free to write any question with any answer choices to follow (obviously with 1 correct answer each).

It is important to change the `value=""` option. For instance, if your answer for a question is the "Phoenix", you need to change the value to be the same thing. This also means, you must change the comparison values in `model.rb` to check for the correct answer.

Feel free to style this app however you choose!
